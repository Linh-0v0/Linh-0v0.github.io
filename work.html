                                   <p>Nguyen Tuan Cuong is the co-founder of Amanotes. Vo Tuan Binh is the co-founder alongside with Cuong.
                                    <br>Amanotes is a game developing company specializing in music games. It was founded in 2015 and since then has become increasingly successful located in Ho Chi Minh city. One of Cuong’s company successful game: Magic Tiles 3: 275 million downloads
                                    <br>A music game start-up named MusicKing was previously created by Binh, but it went bankrupt in 2009. As Binh has the experience of playing the piano, guitar, and Vietnamese bamboo flute and comes from a technological background, Binh decided to begin a new project that mixes music and technology
                                    <br>The vision of creating a startup that focuses on interactive music games was drawn to Cuong. And the two co-founders began to do research of their ideas.

                                    <p>Amanotes was largely self-funded during the company's early days. The team put off the process of finding foreign financing by saving a modest revenue source from creating websites for other Vietnamese enterprises. Cuong says that: 
                                      <br>“We have 4 independent producing teams. They are seen as the startups in Amanotes. Instead of managing multiple people in multiple departments, we only need to work directly with 4 representatives of 4 teams.
                                      <br>Binh and I are responsible for coming up with a joint developing strategy which meets the needs of the markets as well as the company’s motto (Everyone can music). Four teams will develop the product according to the strategy. After every startup complete the product, we will then test the product, release and start a marketing campaign if we see it has the potential." </p>

                                    <p><u>What kind of work is done by the IT professional?</u>></p>

                                    <p>Sophia is a front-end developer.
                                      <br>As a front-end developer, she works with product manager and designer. They collaborate to create an awesome website.
                                      <br>Product manager are business people, they talk to customers and come up with requirements of what is needed to drive the business forward. For example, if they need to add a feature, they come to the designer to come up with a design (UX designer). Then, the front-end designer will implement the design.
                                      <br>She works in JavaScript and range of libraries: React and Backbone; also Html, CSS, JavaScript and front-end framework. Git is used in daily basis.
                                      
                                      <br>A day of her starts with a scrum meeting, her company runs an agile environment, which basically means that every 2 week, they have to have deliverables. Everyone is assigned tasks in order to get these features or small bug fixes done to move the business forward and be productive.
                                      <br>A scrum meeting: talk about what you did yesterday and what you’re gonna do today, to keep people accountable. She shares that she always communicates with product manager, designer to make sure they’re on the same page.
                                      <br>A lot of demos are also needed. Sophia does the demo once a week, and hears other people’s demos to know what they’re doing with the company. Moreover, it is not compulsory but there is also a 1-on-1 weekly meeting with both manager and the lead, to talk about what you’re curious, or concerned.
                                      
                                      She says: 
                                      <br>“I would say that that would total up to around 20 percent of my time then a big portion obviously goes to you guessed it coding and just building stuff in general this involves creating your own branch in order to make your changes and then pushing back into the main branch and just getting all that approval from other people and also just testing it and just making sure that it. All of that work takes around 70% of your time because that is my main job so as a software engineer one which is what I personally am and what you start off with what you usually do is fix either bugs or do small features.”
                                      <br>The last 10% goes into more like random things that are going on with the company so I personally like to attend little webinars of other teams of what they're doing so I find that really interesting like right now.

                                    <p><u>What kind of work is done by the IT professional?</u>></p>

                                   <p>She is a full-time content creator based in San Diego,  second-generation Japanese American and worked for six years as a Senior iOS Software Engineer in Silicon Valley companies like Intuit, Patreon, and Netflix.
                                    <br>Mayuko mostly focused on writing mobile apps and to be specific, mobile apps. She shares that she is what some people call a product engineer since the engineering that she does is directly related to the product that people use. Some engineers are not product engineers by contrast, and they work to provide services for other software engineers, or make improvements to websites and apps that they run faster, and so that they're up and running all the time.</p>

                                    <br>
                                    <p><u>What kinds of people does the IT professional interact with? Are they other IT professionals? Clients? Investors? The general public?
                                      <br>Where do the IT professionals spend most of their time?
                                      </u>></p>

                                    <p>Her sharing about the process of her work goes like this:
                                      <br>We have a product manager or PM, who kicks off this whole process by deciding on what we're building. It then gets handed over to a designer who figures out how is this thing gonna look?
                                      <br>And then finally it gets handed over to the engineer who builds the thing,
                                      <br>The whole process is actually very collaborative and is usually not divided up like how I described as an assembly line. What actually happens is that we all provide our own expertise but then we end up making a lot of decisions together. So I would say a solid 20 percent of my time is spent doing exactly this. I should also mention that this process moves super quickly.
                                      <br>It's not uncommon for us to conceive an idea and get it out within a week or two. Because there are several people involved in this process to keep everyone in the loop, we have frequent meetings in order to communicate what we're all working on. Ok! So 20% of my time is spent working with PM's, designers, and other engineers to discuss what we're working on
                                      <br>
                                      <br>Next, 70% of my time is spent building stuff. So based on the discussions we've had with the product manager and designer, It's up to me and the other engineers to build the thing. My process usually goes something like this...
                                      <br>Number one: figure out a plan for how to build the thing. I asked myself questions like:
                                      Do I need to coordinate with other teams in my company in order to accomplish this?
                                      <br>What classes am I gonna make? Should I use what Apple's provided me, or should I make my own custom version of it? How am I going to format the data that I want to show in the way that I want?
                                      <br>And once I have a plan, sometimes I'll review with other engineers to make sure that my plan makes sense. So lastly, I go and code according to my plan and sometimes it goes according to plan and sometimes it doesn't. But it certainly helps to have a plan so that it saves time and frustration.
                                      <br>In addition to building features, I will be fixing bugs in the mean time or making improvements to our tests and tooling to make development easier. So this whole portion of reading, writing and fixing code takes quite a bit of time because of all the little problems.
                                      <br>
                                      <br>The last 10% of my day is spent doing miscellaneous things.
                                      <br>Things like:
                                      <br>Having one-on-ones with my manager and other people to talk about career stuff
                                      <br>Participating in meetings in other parts of the company to find out what everyone is working on and just working and participating in any other areas that I'm passionate about at work.
                                      20% collaborating with cross-functional roles, 70% building and coding and 10% miscellaneous things around the company and not every day looks the same on the job. 
                                      <br>There are some days where I have meetings all day and I code only for an hour or so and there are other days where I have no meetings and I code for the whole day.
                                      <br>The variety of my days helped me to maintain a good balance.
                                      </p>

                                          <p><u>What kind of work is done by the IT professional?</u>></p>
      
                                          <p>Martin Genev is a front-end lead engineer at Amazon</p>

                                          <br>
                                        <p><u>What aspect of their position is most challenging?</u>></p>

                                          <p>“Today I think getting into the industry is much harder than being in the industry”
                                            <br>You think Front-end was like a little bit of CSS, a little bit of jQuery, a little bit of HTML and you would make you know most front-ends, but at this point the client said the browser applications can become so much more advanced than they used to be, and so are the tools that are making them. So there needs to be a lot of expertise at this point, and all the companies now want nice web applications for their products, so the demand and the sophistication gone through the roof in recent years. It's still a good choice for someone trying to get into web development right now.
                                            <br>I think it's a great choice definitely, for a certain kind of person, it isn't for everybody. I know many many very talented developers who despise the front-end, but also now many many people who only want to code for the front end. So I think it's a great choice if it is your fit. </p>
                                            
                                            <br>
                                            <p><u>What does the IT professionals spend most of their time?</u>></p>

                                            <p>So you have to hear some background in computing altogether, it really really helps. Some people do come from the traditional computer science backgrounds and they can make really good web developer. But I think what really is the motivating factor to focus on fronting in particular is caring for the product and caring to be closer to the customer. So to me, the reason I specialize in front-end is that I wanted to be on that layer, that you, as a user going to see and use, and this made me more passionate and more concerned with what I'm making if I was on another layer of software wares like machine over here machine over here, and I mean between, I would feel a bit too motivated. And I think the benefit of learning web development over, just learning just regular software engineering is that you can see the results right away and it's tangible.</p>
                                            <br>
      
                                            <p><u>What kinds of people does the IT professional interact with? Are they other IT professionals? Clients? Investors? The general public?</u>></p>

                                            <p>Every team has to learn everything from scratch and so it just makes everything a pain in the ass, so then your next card was is how rare and needed front end experts are in big companies. that's an interesting one so it used to be that these big companies they would treat developers as jack-of-all-trades, you know one size fits all and you would enter a big company and you can go and find your area and that's okay, but now that front-end became so much more complex and the expectations are so high. 
                                              <br>Have you have this situation where you may have extremely good developers and some companies out there have them by the thousands, yet if you give them a product which I mostly a client-side application they would struggle to pull it off and then you end up with this situation where a company has hired all the best for decades and in the end, it struggles to make a client-side application. So it comes down to seeking out the different kind of developers who had only appeared in the industry in the last five years so the big companies adapt more slowly to this. So right now big companies that make robust systems and secure systems they were really really towards the server and that poses a lot of challenges in particular for user experience because you have to keep going back to the server for every interaction if your system is heavy on the server. So in recent years, more and more of that logic came to the client, and the same people that were making these big robust backends haven' t retrained themselves to make the client’s, and a new kind of developer has appeared in the industry who is actually focused on that exact bit of the application the client said, and those people are new in the industry and they're harder to find right now.
                                              </p>

                                            <p><u>Martin’s sharing his thought on people’s opinion of developers: </u>></p>

                                            <p>I guess historically people would think of developers as people that are antisocial, and kind of stay over in the corner and just do computer stuff, and don't talk to anybody and in the end, their work 16 hours a day, and their lives are boring, and they have nothing to talk about. I think that has changed a lot. I think that the sociable people though do prefer the front-end, and that's actually how I feel because it gives me, like I said, earlier more connection to people doing front-end, so the fact that I am more outgoing actually helps me as a front-end developer.</p>

                                        <p>Hello my name is John and I am a software engineer at Smartsheet.
                                          <br>Front-end engineer is someone that likes being at the intersection of art and logic. So if you like programming but also like the artistic side of design, and working with customers. Being a front-end engineer is the perfect role for you. 
                                          </p>

                                          <br>
                                        <p><u>What kinds of people does the IT professional interact with? Are they other IT professionals? Clients? Investors? The general public?
                                            <br>Where do the IT professionals spend most of their time?</u>></p>

                                        <p>A common thing that front-end engineers do is you're working with program managers, and designers, and customers to figure out what's the best way to implement a solution for a customer problem. My favorite part about being a friend engineer is being able to work directly with customers and designers, so figuring out, like whether this button should be a certain color, a certain size, like all those fine details that ends up creating the best user experience. That's one of the most rewarding aspects of being a front-end engineer.
                                        <br>One easy way to get started is just to build your own personal website, uh your website can be a expression of who you are, or like what you want to do, um once you're done with that. That's the awesome way to start marketing yourself, saying hey look, I built this awesome website, imagine what I can build for you.
                                        <br>So I wanted to go to art school, um but my parents strongly urged me not to go to art school, so I ended up picking mechanical engineering. I went to a hackathon because being a college student, free food and swag that's awesome, but I ended up staying and joining a team to make a game, and they needed someone to make the art assets, so I was like cool, I get to do some art stuff. Well, while being here but then uh I needed to put our assets into the game somehow, so I had to learn how to program our assets into the game, so that got me hooked into programming and then I eventually learned that front-end engineering is a thing, so it's a great combination of like, being artistic and also being able to program.
