                                    <p><b>Cybersecurity</b> is defined as the defense of computer systems and networks from theft or harm to their devices, software or digital data, as well as from interference or misdirection of the services they offer, is computer security, cybersecurity or information technology security.</p>

                                    <p>Cybersecurity has existed since the creation of the first computer virus in 1971.</p>
                                    <p><b>Privacy</b> is a person or group's right to seclude themselves or data about themselves.</p>

                                   <p>This news is published in 2016. At that time, it is hard to address this problem due to the shortage of public toilets and technology. Fast forward to 2020, over a period of time, the government has paid attention to this problem due to a considerable increase in the number of foreign visitors, and then have erected many public toilets in the city. On top of that, thanks to the development of e-commerce like Shopee, NowShip, Tiki, Grab, etc. there is a great surge in the number of people using the smartphone. Therefore, I feel that now is a suitable time to have an application helping people locate the closest public toilet and designated dump location.</p>

                                              <dd>New technology such as AI can be potentially misunderstood as future vulnerabilities in cybersecurity. The reason why people get the wrong impression of AI’s utilization in IT security because they may think that AI systems will backfire the security wall as AI are likely to become a big target for hackers with more companies relying on machine learning.
                                              <br>However, AI can be utilized in a beneficial way. Developers of cybersecurity can use AI to fix vulnerabilities on their own, recognize vulnerability problems even before they can be exploited, and repel the cyberattacks when they started. That is why AI technology might be used in order to protect data from highly advanced and destructive malware, ransomware, and social engineering threats. AI is not yet conscious, but there is potentially a future for AI cognitive autonomy in anticipating and preventing cyber threats.
                                              <br>On the other hand, Machine Learning is the quickest way to detect new cyber threats, draw mathematical deduction. In order to help avoid repetitive attacks and respond to changing behaviours, cybersecurity technologies can recognize patterns with Machine Learning. It will assist cybersecurity organizations to be more proactive in mitigating threats and responding to the ongoing attacks in real time. This would decrease the amount of time spending on repetitive activities and allow businesses to more strategically use their manpower. 
                                              <br>AI and ML may assist with identity management through cross-checking the authenticity of data in various databases.

                                              <dd>Adaptive Networks are automated and programmable networks that can customize, track, control and respond to evolving needs. Three specific layers are used for these networks: 1. programmable infrastructure, 2. analytics and intelligence, and 3. software for automatic control.
                                                <br>The programmable infrastructure layer functions as a sensor and provides real-time data on network output and vulnerabilities, helping agencies to proactively repair them and distribute resources appropriately.
                                                <br>The end layer is technology for monitoring and automation. It optimizes software-defined network architectures and multi-domain service orchestration to simplify network management and service delivery through multi-vendor, multi-domain hybrid networks. Such layers combine to build a more versatile, elastic and secure network.
                                                <br>An Adaptive Network lets agencies address rising bandwidth constraints, as well as modernization and security requirements, providing customers with state of the art and faster services.

It is a digital transaction ledger that doesn’t need a central control point. There is a full ledger’s copy on every computer, or node, so one or two nodes going down would not lead to any loss of data.</dd>

                                 <p>Another good feature coming to View Live is the ability to automatically turn on the AR mode when you meet transit directions. For example, when you exit a subway station and find yourself at a busy and potentially complicated intersection, you can see more clearly how you are guided.</p>

                                     <p><b>My opinion:</b></p>
                                  <p>In my opinion, AR is not only a new way of entertainment, but I also consider AR like a new form of UI Design. The interaction that AR brings to digital devices becomes so much more enjoyable. Like what you see in the AR Google Maps, the road guides become even more specific, it is less confusing to go to your wanted location, especially when you meet those complex intersections during your way. I really look forward to the release of this technology as it seems to make everyone’s life more convenient.</p>

                                    <p>Source: <a href="https://www.16i.co.uk/m-journal/the-technology-behind-pokemon-go/#:~:text=The%20app%20uses%20your%20GPS,famous%20monsters%20against%20the%20background." target="_blank">Link</a></p>

                                    <p>In partnership with The Pokémon Corporation for iOS and Android smartphones, Pokémon Go is a virtual reality mobile game which was released in 2016 and produced by Niantic. As a part of Pokemon franchise, the game is the result of a successful collab between Nitendo, Niantic and the Pokemon Corporation. When the game was released, it took the world by storm with 1 billion downloads.
                                      <br>The rule of the game is that instead of playing a character in a virtual world, you now control a character in an augmented reality (AR) version of your environment. The app uses your GPS to link to real-world location, and Pokémon can show up in different locations.
                                      <br>Pokémon Go also uses the back camera of your device, allowing Pokémon to appear in real life by imposing an illustration of one of the famous creatures of the game.
                                      <br>The reasons why the game becomes so popular due to its immersive and interactive ways of playing compared to other contemporary games. Besides, it is the first app that provides AR technology for free.
